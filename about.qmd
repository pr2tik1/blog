Hello! üëã I am a software engineer who loves working on websites, AI, and data-related projects. When I'm not coding, I enjoy going on treks, exploring new cuisines, and playing sports like football, badminton, cricket, and table tennis. I love photography and watching exciting movies like "Edge of Tomorrow". And I am always up for a coffee !

Currently, I am working at [**Elucidata**](https://www.elucidata.io/), solving some of the complex problems in drug discovery.
